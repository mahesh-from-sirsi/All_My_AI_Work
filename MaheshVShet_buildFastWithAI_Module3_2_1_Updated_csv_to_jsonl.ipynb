It also rests on a mutual understanding of interiority and vulnerability. Moreover, it requires from us that we reflect on our actions in light of that which comes to pass for others, even in multiple, often conflicting, contexts and roles. If all this is mitigated through machines, and anonymized, moral responsibility becomes eroded.

            "{'Input': 'Write a LinkedIn post in an enthusiastic, professional, and informative tone about a new AI tool or model. The post should include:\\n\\nAn exciting opening that hooks the reader and mentions the AI tool.\\n\\nA clear breakdown of why the tool matters (bullet points for key advantages or unique features).\\n\\nSimple steps to get started, ideally 2‚Äì3 actionable instructions.\\n\\nHighlights of a demo or examples showing the tool in action.\\n\\nImplications for developers, researchers, and businesses, including potential opportunities.\\n\\nA clear takeaway summarizing why this tool is important.\\n\\nOptional fun note about how AI helped generate the post.\\n\\nUse bullet points for clarity where needed, keep the tone approachable yet authoritative, and include emojis sparingly to make the post lively.', 'Output': 'Exciting video today! üöÄ\\nIn this clip I dive into GPT-OSS from OpenAI ‚Äì the lighter, consumer-friendly version of the model that‚Äôs been a game-changer for many of us in the AI community. Below is a quick rundown of what we cover and why it matters for developers, researchers, and businesses alike.\\nWHY GPT-OSS IS A BIG DEAL\\n‚Ä¢ Runs on consumer hardware ‚Äì just 16 GB of VRAM (or 32 GB on a modern Mac with shared memory) is enough to get it up and running.\\n ‚Ä¢ Versatile setup ‚Äì On Windows you‚Äôll need computer with a solid GPU (budget options available for $750‚Äì$1,200).\\n ‚Ä¢ Open-source and permissive ‚Äì No proprietary lock-in, perfect for edge-device deployment and offline use.\\nGETTING STARTED\\n‚Ä¢ I use OLLAMA (ollama.com): simply type gpt-oss:20b and hit download.\\n ‚Ä¢ Once the model is ready, we launch a couple of benchmark tests to see the magic unfold.\\nDEMO HIGHLIGHTS\\n‚Ä¢ Physics Engine ‚Äì The model writes a small Python physics engine, complete with chain-of-thought reasoning that you can read, enhancing interpretability.\\n ‚Ä¢ Flappy Bird Implementation ‚Äì A benchmark that many models struggle with; GPT-OSS nails it, often outperforming larger, proprietary systems.\\nWHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE COMMUNITY\\n‚Ä¢ Edge AI ‚Äì Run powerful models locally with minimal connectivity.\\n ‚Ä¢ Accelerated R&D ‚Äì Opens doors for rapid prototyping and experimentation.\\n ‚Ä¢ Business models ‚Äì Potential for support-and-service offerings around open-weight tech.\\n ‚Ä¢ Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning ‚Äì You can fine-tune with only 24 GB of VRAM, a true game-changer for resource-constrained teams.\\nüí° Takeaway: GPT-OSS brings top-tier performance to everyday hardware, making AI more accessible, interpretable, and open. If you‚Äôre curious about what an open-weight model can do‚Äîgive the video a watch, and let me know your thoughts or any questions you have in the comments!\\nOh yes‚Ä¶.\\nGPT-OSS HELPED ME WRITE THIS POST ü§Ø OFFLINE'}\n",
            "{'Input': 'Write a LinkedIn post in an enthusiastic and professional tone about a recent experience with an open-source AI model. Include:\\n\\nA brief personal anecdote or test you ran with the model.\\n\\nImpressive performance details (e.g., ran on a consumer GPU, open-source advantage).\\n\\nConstructive feedback or something you wish were available.\\n\\nA friendly call-to-action encouraging comments or engagement about tutorials, guides, or insights.\\nKeep the post around 120‚Äì150 words, use a conversational style, and make it shareable for the tech community.', 'Output': 'Looks like OpenAI really hit a home run with GPT-OSS. I gave it a common physics polygon test, and it performed exceptionally well‚Äîmoreover, it did so on a consumer GPU. With open-source AI, everyone wins!\\nOne thing I‚Äôd like to see is the training data open-sourced as well, but you can‚Äôt have everything... yet:)\\nComment if you want to see content on how to run open-source models and local AI.\\nWant to learn how to run open-source AI models on your own machine? Drop a comment below and I might just share step-by-step guides on setting up environments, installing dependencies, and squeezing the best performance out of your local GPU!'}\n",
